Setting up a contact form with backend integration
Adding animations and transitions
Implementing a search functionality for blog posts
Adding a portfolio filtering system
Setting up analytics
Adding a newsletter subscription
Implementing SEO optimizations
Something else?


Let me explain the Firebase implementation plan:

First, we'll need to:
Install Firebase
Set up a Firebase project
Configure Firebase in our Next.js app
Then we'll create:
Authentication context
Sign In page
Sign Up page
Protected routes
User profile page
Would you like me to help you start with the Firebase setup? We can:

Install Firebase dependencies
Create a new Firebase project
Set up the configuration
Let me know if you want to proceed with the setup, and I'll guide you through each step!



Add Google Sign-in support
Create a protected dashboard page
Add analytics event tracking
Or something else?


Firebase's free tier ("Spark Plan") includes:

Authentication with multiple providers (email/password, Google, etc.)
Up to 50,000 monthly active users
Multiple authentication methods
Secure token generation
Email verification
Password reset functionality


// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

PRODUCTION RULES

Security: Since we're in test mode, remember to update the Firebase Storage rules to production rules when you're ready to deploy:
rules
CopyInsert
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /blog-images/{imageId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can view blog images
      allow write: if request.auth != null  // Must be logged in
                   && request.auth.token.email_verified == true  // Email verified
                   && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024  // Max 5MB
                   && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*')  // Must be image
                   && request.resource.contentType in ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];
    }
    
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
